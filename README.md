Portfolio/sandbox for me to work with

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/de38faac-ff43-4250-a70a-4cdd92db7340/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/reedthazen-test/deploys)

This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

Will need to build a new project: `yarn build`

then run `yarn dev` (`next dev`) to get a dev server with Fast Refresh enabled

`yarn start` will start a dev server as well, but it will be whatever is in the build in the .next folder after running `yarn build`
